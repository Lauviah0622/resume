## Hi, I'm Lance

Experienced in experience in graphical applications, charting tools, marketing campaign  editors. From a technical perspective, I am primarily skilled in frontend development tools and the React ecosystem.

My journey began in design than transitioned into programming, which has brought me empathy for end-users and passionate about user experience.

I enjoy exploring various techs, attending conferences, and occasionally contributing to open-source projects. Lately, I've been delving into C Lang and Linux. Besides programming, I've been into calisthenic training.
