## Hi, I'm Lance

Experienced in experience in graphical applications, charting tools, marketing campaign  editors and E-commerce. From a technical perspective, I am primarily skilled in frontend development tools and the React ecosystem.

My journey began in design than transitioned into programming, which has brought me empathy for end-users and passionate about user experience.

Outside of work, I like to explore new and interesting technologies and occasionally contribute to open-source projects. Recently I’ve been spending more time on backend and mobile app development. Beyond coding, I’m currently learning to play the trumpet.
