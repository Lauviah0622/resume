## Hi, I'm Lance

With about two years work experience, I have experience developing various company products, including graphical applications, charting tools, marketing games, and associated editors. From a technical perspective, I am primarily skilled in frontend development tools and the React ecosystem.

As a developer, I'm not in related major but the media and design. My diverse experience has given me empathy for users and a deep understanding of user experience in product development.

Apart from my professional work, I enjoy exploring various technologies, attending conferences, and occasionally contributing to open-source projects. Lately, I've been delving into Next.js and SSR-related technologies. Outside of my development work, I also engage in calisthenics training.
