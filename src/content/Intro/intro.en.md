## Hi, I'm Lance

Being in touch with dynamic image, photography and design during college, finally get into front-end. The path I walked let me have more sensitivity of design.

I believe "You become Software developer first, then Front-end developer. ", so trying to fill the computer science basic knowledge vacancy.

The comic is my hobby continuously in seventeen years. Otherwise, I love everything about photography and motorcycle. 

In half year, I establish my blog, and read first and second chapter of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". And I'm learning Typescript and Test-driven-development recently.
