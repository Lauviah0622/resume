Developed a visualization application tailored for NoSQL graph databases:
- Utilized React alongside Pixi.js for efficient Canvas rendering, enabling the display of over 1,000 nodes while maintaining interactive features such as drag-and-drop, style adjustments, and clustering.
- Simplified the rendering model and interface to better suit lightweight static use cases, such as document previews and style configuration.
